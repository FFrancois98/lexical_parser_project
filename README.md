**To run my code you need to have linux of some sort on your machine:**
* For Mac Users, just using your terminal is fine.
* For Windows Usersm you have to download Linux SubSystem for Windows onto your machine.

**The Steps to running my code:**
* Download my folder from GitHub.
* Open filepath in terminal/windows susbsystem.
* In terminal, type in `make` and press enter. That should create a file called **parser**. This is our executable file. 
* To check if **parser** is there, type `ls` in the cmd.
* Now that **parser** exists, to run the program, you type in `./parser <filename>` where filename is input file you are using.
* If the input file is not in the same folder as the program, the full filepath has to be written.
