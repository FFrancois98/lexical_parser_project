**To run my code you need to have linux of some sort on your machine**
* For Mac Users, just using your terminal is fine
* For Windows Usersm you have to download Linux SubSystem for Windows unto your machine

**The Steps to running my code:**
* Download my folder from GitHub
* Open filepath in terminal/windows susbsystem
* in terminal, type the make command and enter. that should create a file called parser. This is our executable file. 
* to check, type ls in the cmd.
* Now that parser exists, to run the program, you type in './parser <filename>'
* where filename is input file you are using.
* if the input file is not in the same folder as the program,
* the full filepath has to be written.
